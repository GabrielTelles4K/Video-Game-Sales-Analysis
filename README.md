# Video-Game-Sales-Analysis
This repository contains my analysis of a dataset of video game sales worldwide. The goal of this project is to explore the data and generate the best insights about the market, consumer preferences, trends and challenges of the gaming industry. The data was obtained from the website [Kaggle] and covers the period from 1980 to 2016.
